  This skill should be used when the user works on the adapter layer,
  coordinator, pgwire, frontend peek path, peek client, timestamp oracle,
  batching oracle, or related crates. Trigger when the user mentions or edits
  files in src/adapter/, src/pgwire/, src/timestamp-oracle/, or mentions
  frontend, coordinator, read holds, timestamp selection, timestamp oracle,
  batching oracle, or query sequencing.

# Adapter Guide Skill

When working on the adapter layer or related crates, always read and follow the
guidance in `src/adapter/GUIDE.md` before making changes. That document
contains correctness invariants, architectural notes, and a list of
optimizations that have been tried and rejected for correctness reasons.

Read `src/adapter/GUIDE.md` now.

When working on the timestamp oracle (`src/timestamp-oracle/`), also read the
module-level docs in `src/timestamp-oracle/src/lib.rs` and
`src/timestamp-oracle/src/batching_oracle.rs` for the `TimestampOracle` trait
contract and the batching/linearizability invariants.
