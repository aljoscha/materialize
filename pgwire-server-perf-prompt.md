I'm working on a testbed for testing how far we can push throughput with our
pgwire implementation and adapter frontend. We have a log file in
@pgwire-server-perf-log.md where we keep recording findings for future
sessions.

Figure out how we can improve latency and throughput. For this, we need to use
sampling to figure out where our time in processing these simple queries is
going and fix it.

We want to try one optimization, then note down our results in the log file and
then stop. I'll then start a new session to try and tackle the next thing. We
don't want to add optimizations that cache the result of a query and then
return that straightaway, we want to truly improve the whole processing
pipeline, remove bottlenecks.

After we tried an optimization and noted down results in our log, add a good
description to the jj change and start a new one with jj new for the next
session.

Don't run tests, right now this will only slow us down. We're happy as long as
we can run our queries.

We have dbbench at ~/dbbench/dbbench, and you can use this script for testing:
duration=20s

[64 connections]
query=select * from t
concurrency=64

We are currently benchmarking bin/environmentd --optimized.

When benchmarking, it's important to first login as mz_system and enable
frontend peek sequencing via `alter system set
enable_frontend_peek_sequencing=true;`.

Please focus on where we spend time in try_frontend_peek_inner, or rather
try_frontend_peek_cached, which is really hit in our benchmark. It looks like
the time spent in that function goes up as we increase the number of concurrent
clients. Run benchmarks and profiling to figure out why that time goes up as
concurrency of clients goes up.

You can look at prometheus metrics for environmentd at
http://localhost:6878/metrics. Interesting metrics for us are
mz_frontend_peek_seconds, with the try_frontend_peek_cached label. This covers
the runtime of try_frontend_peek_cached mentioned above. These are histograms,
so you have to look at the one with the _bucket suffix and figure out the
histogram by yourself. As a first step look at how that varies with number of
concurrent clients and then find out why that is. Maybe there is something in
there that still forces us to serialize through something, maybe a client call
or something like that.
